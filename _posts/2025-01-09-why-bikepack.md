  Bikepacking is a way of traveling and seeing the world, often involving less asphalt and more dirt/gravel. It’s about riding somewhere with enough gear to spend the night outside. The intersection of cycling and backpacking. For the sake of one’s spine, all gear is strapped to the bike in one way or another, often forcing a minimalist approach and creative solutions. Bikepacking is much slower paced than driving, allowing for one to really take in their surroundings. It’s also faster than hiking, making it possible to still cover great distances each day and maintain a sense of momentum. The perfect happy medium. It takes traveling from point A to point B and turns it into a nimble, self-supported, and connected adventure full of dicovery.

  A bike provides an immensely connected experience to one’s surroundings. I vividly remember many places I’ve ridden because of their terrain and the people I met while there. Much more than I ever could behind the wheel of a car because I was truly experiencing the location and what it had to offer. Every detail of the craziest hills have carved their place into my mind with each pedal stroke. This sounds miserable, and it can be, but [type 2 fun](https://www.rei.com/blog/climb/fun-scale) is simply more memorable than type 1. It's far easier to recall Jake, Georgia, and I carrying our bikes as we waded through a swamp along a flooded snowmobile trail opposed to recalling the days when everything went right and was easy(those rarely happen). 
  
  While on a bike, I’ve found that one is much more approachable to those in the communities passed through. They see a sunburnt and tired soul on a bike loaded with gear and get curious. Maybe for a moment they can live vicariously through your telling of the adventure past or yet to come. Maybe they can provide their own tellings of past adventures, stories of the community, advice for the journey ahead, or simply some much needed conversation and human interaction. Many of these offhand interactions have become the most prominent memories of my adventures. A few of these interactions are as follows:

  -From a man who looked like he was straight out of an 1800’s mine, learning the history of a lake that used to be an open-pit mine
  
  -A tour of Bob Dylan’s childhood home
  
  -An introduction to the baker that has made the best roadside caramel rolls for ~20 years 
  
  -A tour of the sewing room at prominent bikepacking bag company after the owner saw the homemade bags on my bike
  
  -So many conversations at bars where I’m welcomed as just another regular (WARNING: Regulars often like to buy tired          bikepackers beer, drink responsibly)

In short, people are much more likely to approach and initialize conversation if you appear out of the ordinary.
